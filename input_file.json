HC had an in-depth conversation to fully understand the client\u2019s needs and determine how best to provide support. The client is specifically seeking low-income or Section 42 housing, with a preference for a 4-bedroom unit. After the call, HC spent the remainder of the time searching for available 4-bedroom housing options. This proved to be a particularly challenging task, as affordable 4-bedroom units are hard to come by. Despite these challenges, HC remained focused and committed, diligently working to identify any potential options that could meet the client\u2019s needs.HC was able to locate a property that matched the client's criteria, offering both a 4-bedroom unit and low-income eligibility. HC immediately left an inquiry for more information about the property. Additionally, HC reached out to other properties, but unfortunately, those had different requirements that did not align with the client\u2019s needs\n\nApartment: Little Earth of United Tribes\n\nPhone number:\n\n612-729-9361\n\n*******************************\nApartment: The Arrow Apartments\n*******************************\n\nPhone number: 855-380-8578\n\nhttps://www.realtor.com/rentals/details/117-27th-Ave-SE_Minneapolis_MN_55414_M84436-32723",
